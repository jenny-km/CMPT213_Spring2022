Dear TA,
This is Jennifer Kim and I am writing to inform you that my partner decided to drop out of class without telling me in advance.
I talked to our professor about my current situation and he allowed for some accomodations.
1. He told me to implement the simplest way that the tanks could be placed on the field. This does not have to be randomized.
2. He said that I could submit 6 days late.
3. He told me that I would need to inform you through a readme file.

If there's any questions or concerns please let me know! 
Thank you!
